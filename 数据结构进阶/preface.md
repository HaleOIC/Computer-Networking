Althogh my data structure's grade is 99 scores.

I don't think I have the enough knowledge to support my chase for my dream.So I wanna learn advanced data structure.Maybe it is hard to understand.I will try my best to solve all the problems.

Lists for learning are as follows: 

- **vector** and **list** in the STL /// implementation of **vector**

- AVL and Splay Tree 

- Sets and Maps in the Standard Library

- Hash Tables in the Standard Library /// some other hashing 

- prioirty queue 

- External sorting 

- Euler graphs 

- Amortized Analysis

- Treap. Suffix arrays and suffix trees 

- K-d tree and pairing heaps

  All in all, the refferrence book is <data structure and algorithm analysis in C++>
